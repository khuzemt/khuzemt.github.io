**How to publish your page on Github**

This topic discusses how to publish your page on Github.

(Not too detailed. I wouldn't depend on it. I'm just learning stuff right now.)

Before we begin, create an account on Github.

1. Log in to your account on Github.
2. Click **Create a repository** or **New Repository**.
3. Enter your repository name. The best practice is to name it as username.github.io, where *username* is, well, your username. 
4. Select the Readme option by selecting the check box.
5. Click **Create Repository**.
6. Click **Create new file** and name it index.html.
7. Paste the contents of your html file here.
8. Click **Commit changes**.
9. Click the Readme.md file and click the pencil icon to edit it.
10. Prepend your repository name with "http://". For example, if your repository name is trying.github.io, then change it to http://trying.github.io.
11. Click **Commit changes**.
12. Click the link and your newly created page opens up in a browser window.
